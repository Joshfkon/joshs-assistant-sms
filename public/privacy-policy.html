  <h2>Program Name</h2>
  <p>Josh's Assistant SMS</p>

  <h2>What This Service Does</h2>
  <p>Josh's Assistant SMS is a personal, AI-powered text messaging service. When you send a text message to our phone number, you may receive an automated reply. The service is inbound-only: messages are only sent in direct response to messages you send first. No unsolicited or marketing messages are ever sent.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you text our number, the following information is processed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your phone number</strong> &mdash; provided by the carrier as part of the SMS delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Message content</strong> &mdash; the text of the message you send.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Message content is passed to an AI service (Anthropic Claude) to generate a reply. Messages are not stored persistently by our application. We do not maintain conversation history or user profiles.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive your inbound text message.</li>
    <li>Generate and deliver an automated reply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Your message content is sent to Anthropic (our AI provider) solely for the purpose of generating a response. Twilio is used as our messaging platform to send and receive SMS messages.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Our application does not store your messages or phone number. Standard server logs and Twilio message logs may retain data in accordance with their respective retention policies.</p>

  <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
  <p>You can stop receiving messages at any time by simply not texting the number. Since this is an inbound-only service, no messages will be sent to you unless you text first. You may also text <strong>STOP</strong> to opt out.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, text <strong>HELP</strong> to our number or contact us at the support information provided in our Terms and Conditions.</p>
